# Julia Set Generator

A simple Zig-based program that renders a time-evolving Julia set and outputs individual frames as `.ppm` images. You can then convert them into an MP4 animation using FFmpeg.

---

## 🧰 Dependencies

- **[Zig](https://ziglang.org/)** – To build and run the program
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** – To convert the frames into an MP4 video

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Debug Mode
```bash
zig build run
````

### Release Mode

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast run
```

> This will generate `.ppm` frames inside the `frames/` directory.

---

## 🎞️ Convert Frames to MP4

To convert the frames into a 60 FPS video using FFmpeg:

```bash
cd frames
ffmpeg -framerate 60 -i frame_%04d.ppm -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
```

The result will be an animation of the evolving Julia set saved as `out.mp4`.

Feel free to experiment with different parameters to create new variations of the Julia set!
